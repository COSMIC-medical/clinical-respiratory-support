# Clinical Respiratory Support
### A COSMIC Medical Project

This repository contains all the concept files necessary to construct a clinical respiratory support system designed to provide positive pressure and remove contaminated air in field hospital settings. Please read license.pdf before using any of the files to understand the liabilities and limitations you are responsible for by using this repository.

## System Overview (DRAFT)
This repository contains the design concept document for the Clinical Respiratory Support (CRS) system. It is designed as a purely mechanical system to deliver HEPA-filtered air and capture contagious particles from patients requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, as in those with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The CRS system can be used in settings without access to bedside medical air and only requires household electrical access, such as in field hospitals and other non-conventional hospital settings.
This is achieved using two parallel air manifolds, each driven with a separate motor. The air entering and exiting the system are both treated, either by HEPA filter or other means, thus reducing risks to the patient and surrounding providers. Each system can serve multiple patients simultaneously, and can be monitored from a single position by a single trained healthcare provider, if necessary. The CRS utilizes readily available construction components and basic medical supplies, and is thus not reliant on critical links in medical supply chains.
The document provided does not outline the sourcing and production of a CRS in great detail. Rather, it is meant to provide a framework for its end-user to develop their own system using the principles and keeping important considerations in mind. The intention of this was to leave the end-user as free as possible given the countless possibilities of available supplies in these settings.
